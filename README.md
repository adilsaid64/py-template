# py-template

PyTemplate is a free boilerplate for building and managing custom Python libraries.

It provides:

 - A ready-to-use project structure for Python libraries
 - Automated semantic-versioning and GitHub tagging workflows
 - CI/CD and packaging setup so you can focus on writing code, not boilerplate workflows
